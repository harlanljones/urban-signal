# Dispatch log

The orchestrator appends one row per launched stream, then closes it out with
an outcome. Without this record a stream that produced nothing (failure mode
F2) leaves no evidence it ever existed, and stream yield is not computable.

Format: one table per dispatch date. Yield = streams with a committed,
durable artifact ÷ streams dispatched.

## 2026-08-23 — city expansion (Seattle / Los Angeles / research)

| Stream id | Leaf claim | Spine needed | Dispatched | Outcome | Yielded artifact |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| city-seattle | `src/spatial/cities/seattle.py` + tests | config.py, city_registry.py, cities/__init__.py | ~09:00 PT | interrupted mid-spine — torn write: enum + aliases landed, REGISTRY entry did not | partial (completed by takeover) |
| city-los-angeles | `src/spatial/cities/los_angeles.py` + tests | config.py, city_registry.py, cities/__init__.py, producers | ~09:00 PT | silent stream — no durable output at takeover; recovered later in mainline work | recovered |
| research-cities | `docs/research/city-expansion-candidates.md` | none | ~09:00 PT | silent stream — findings existed only in agent context | none at takeover |

**Yield at takeover:** 0.33 (1 of 3). **Torn-write exposure:** breached until
takeover repair; duration unknown — no CI signal existed to date it.
Full post-mortem: `docs/adr/0001-agent-interlock.md` sections 1 and 7.

## 2026-08-23 — dashboard city wiring (Seattle / Los Angeles)

| Stream id | Leaf claim | Spine needed | Dispatched | Outcome | Yielded artifact |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| dashboard-seattle | `.streams/dashboard-seattle.md` (spec only) | none — target `src/serving/dashboard.py` held by integrator | ~12:20 PT | completed | spec (applied same day) |
| dashboard-los-angeles | `.streams/dashboard-los_angeles.md` (spec only) | none — same shared-file hold | ~12:20 PT | completed | spec (applied same day) |
| interlock (orchestrator) | apply both specs serially + verify + sync `workers/public/index.html` | n/a | ~12:30 PT | completed | dashboard edit, worker static copy |

**Yield:** 2 of 2 leaf streams. Shared file edited once, serially, after both
specs landed — no concurrent write to `dashboard.py`.
